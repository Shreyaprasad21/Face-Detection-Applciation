## Introduction

This project provides a real-time face detection application using OpenCV for image processing and Streamlit for creating an interactive web interface. It captures video from your webcam and uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces.

## Features

- Real-time face detection through webcam.
- Simple and interactive user interface using Streamlit.
- Easy to set up and run.
- Uses Haar Cascade classifiers for face detection.

## Dependencies

The main dependencies required for this project are:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- Streamlit
- NumPy

All dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation
